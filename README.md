Plans for this year's advent of code:

to learn new programming languages that might take over in the future years.

languages:
1. Rust
2. Go
3. Holy C
4. C

Order in which they are to be done:

1. C
2. Go
3. Holy C
4. Rust

As i know i will not be able to complete all of them, hence i will try to complete at least 2 of them and will extend it as far as i can. if i'm not able to complete a challenge in the given language, then i will complete it C programming language.
