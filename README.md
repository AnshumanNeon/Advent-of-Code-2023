Plans for this year's advent of code:

to learn new programming languages that might take over in the future years.

languages:
1. Rust
2. Carbon
3. Zig
4. Typescript
5. Go
6. Holy C
7. Swift
8. Mojolang
9. Lobster
10. C

Order in which they are to be done:

1. Mojo
2. C
3. Typescript
4. Go
5. Holy C
6. Zig
7. Lobster
8. Rust
9. Swift
10. Carbon

As i know i will not be able to complete all of them, hence i will try to complete at least 3 of them and will extend it as far as i can. if i'm not able to complete a challenge in the given language, then i will complete it C programming language.
